Assets server
===

This is a Restful API service for creating and serving binary assets over HTTP, built with [Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

Running the server
---

First you have to have access to an [openstack swift](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/) installation. Then make your details available as environment variables:

``` bash
export OS_USERNAME=my_username
export OS_PASSWORD=x345sftn33f
export OS_AUTH_URL="https://swift.example.com/v2/"
export OS_TENANT_NAME=my_project
```

Then, to run the server locally:

``` bash
make setup    # Install dependencies
make develop  # Run development server on port 8012
```

### Python environment

By default `make setup` will create a new python environment in a folder called `env` in the project directory.

However, if you first create a [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/), `make setup` will install dependencies into there instead. E.g.:

``` bash
mkvirtualenv assets-server  # Make our custom virtual environment using virtualenvwrapper
make setup                  # Install dependencies into this new environment
```

### Server ports

You can tell the development server to run on any port using the `PORT` environment variable. E.g.:

``` bash
PORT=9001 make develop  # Run the development server on port 9001
```

Production setup
---

### Security

As the server only uses a basic token for authentication, it is paramount that in a production setting, the API functions are only accessed over HTTPS, to keep the API token secret. For this reason, when `DEBUG==false` the server will force a redirect to HTTPS for all API calls.

### Caching

The server is intended to be run in production behind a caching layer (e.g. [squid cache](http://www.squid-cache.org/)). And as the server stores assets by default with a unique hash corresponding to the file's contents (e.g. <code><b>a2f56da4</b>-some-image.png</code>), the cache expiration time should be as long as possible to maximise performance.

Using the server
---

### Tokens

To interact with the assets server, you'll need to generate an authentication token:

``` bash
$ scripts/get-token.sh your-name  # Generate a new token called "your-name"
Token 'your-name' created
3fe479a6b8184be4a4cdf42085f19f9a
```

You can now pass this token in your requests to the assets server API. E.g.:

```
http://localhost:8012/v1/?token=3fe479a6b8184be4a4cdf42085f19f9a  # List all existing assets in JSON format
```

You can list all tokens with [scripts/list-tokens.sh](scripts/list-tokens.sh) or delete them with [scripts/delete-token.sh](scripts/delete-token.sh).

### Uploading assets via the command-line

The [asset-uploader project](https://github.com/ubuntudesign/asset-uploader) helps you upload assets from the command-line:

``` bash
$ ./upload-asset.py  \
    --server-url https://assets.EXAMPLE.com/v1/  \
    --auth-token XXXXXXXX  \
    MY-IMAGE.png
{'url': u'https://assets.EXAMPLE.com/v1/xxxxx-MY-IMAGE.png', 'image': True, 'created': u'Tue Sep 27 16:13:22 2016', 'file_path': u'xxxxx-MY-IMAGE.png', 'tags': u''}
```

You can also use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html):

``` bash
$ echo "asset=$(base64 -w 0 MY-IMAGE.png)" | \
  curl --data @- --data "friendly-name=MY-IMAGE.png" "https://assets.EXAMPLE.com/v1/?token=XXXXXX"
{
    "optimized": false, 
    "created": "Wed Sep 28 11:07:33 2016", 
    "file_path": "xxxxxxxx-MY-IMAGE.png", 
    "tags": ""
}
```

### Assets manager

You may wish to setup the [assets-manager](https://github.com/ubuntudesign/assets-manager/), a simple web interface for managing assets on your assets server.

Tests
---

First create a new token for the tests to use:

``` bash
scripts/get-token.sh tests > tests/fixtures/api-token
```

Run the tests with [pytest](http://pytest.org/):

``` bash
py.test tests/
```
